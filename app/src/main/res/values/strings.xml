    <string name="about_me">I am a 6th semester Computer Science student at Institute Technology of Kalimantan, I\'ve been in love to
    programming since I was writing my first program back when I was in vocational school, I remember
    wasting a lot of time back then just to trying different tags and tutorials on google. Ever since that time I
    knew programming itâ€™s something that I like.
    \n
    This passion brings me through learning about solving real-world problem using technology as solution.
    Until I was participated in technology-based competition like Hackathon, at this competition really
    challenge my programming skills and communication skills. I was responsible for the development of an
    Android Mobile App this bring me to opportunity to learn about connecting android app and API. Beside
    of that I also have interest in Python programming, which I use for my last project about Sentiment
    Analysis from twitter about COVID-19 in Indonesia.
    \n
    I hoped that someday I will be working as software engineer, but there certainly more things that I really
    want to learn, so I am really excited and burning with motivation for learning not just about programming
    but also about life in general. </string>
